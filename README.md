Coding the State!

Optimus is an attempt to capture and model the institutional logics of the Rule of Law through algorithms. This project simulates the interactions between legal and political systems within a Rule of Law-based framework. 
It reflects the vision of the first Liberal Professors of the Vormärz era, who coined the term Rechtsstaat—a state governed by laws and not arbitrary power.

However, it goes beyond just the Rule of Law—it’s a universal institutional logic that applies to any institution. The same coding method is used across systems, from legal frameworks to economic models, based on four essential rules:

The Four Rules of the Optimus Method

1. Functional Differentiation: Institutions are divided into distinct, autonomous units that each have a specific function. Whether it’s legislative, judicial, or executive, each part is self-contained but essential to the system as a whole.
2. Autopoiesis: Each unit regulates itself according to its own binary logic. For example, the legal system works with valid/invalid, while the political system works with legitimate/illegitimate decisions. This self-regulation keeps the system stable and consistent.
3. Structural Coupling: Although each unit is autonomous, they interact with each other through stable but flexible mechanisms. These interactions allow the institution to evolve without collapsing, keeping the units separate but interdependent.
4. Society: A central orchestrator ensures that all units work together harmoniously, iterating over time to refine and adapt the system. This is where societal evolution happens, as interactions are constantly monitored and adjusted.

Application

By following these four rules, Optimus successfully models a variety of institutions:

- The French Fifth Republic (political system).
- Franprix, simulating a grocery store’s sales and restocking processes.
- A bakery, representing economic microcosms.
- Complex completely theoretical social systems as in "plain autopoietic.py"

This universal logic allows for the expansion and adaptation of the method to other systems, demonstrating how a consistent approach can be applied to both societal and economic structures.
