## Optimus: Coding the State 

Optimus is an attempt to capture and model the institutional logics of the State and the Rule of Law through algorithmic structures. This project simulates interactions between legal and political systems within a framework designed to reflect a constitutional logic—one where institutions operate independently yet interdependently, ensuring a State governed by laws and structured processes rather than arbitrary power.

Beyond the Rule of Law, Optimus encapsulates a universal institutional logic applicable across various domains. The same coding principles are used to model diverse systems, from legal frameworks to economic microcosms, based on four foundational rules:

The Four Rules of the Optimus Method

1. Functional Differentiation: Institutions are divided into distinct, autonomous units, each serving a specific function. Legislative, judicial, and executive branches, for example, operate as independent parts essential to the coherence of the entire system.
   
2. Autopoiesis: Each unit self-regulates according to its own binary logic. The legal system, for instance, operates on valid/invalid distinctions, while the political system is driven by legitimate/illegitimate decisions. This internal regulation keeps each unit stable and consistent.

3. 	Structural Coupling: Although each unit remains autonomous, they interact through stable, flexible mechanisms. These interactions enable the institution to evolve cohesively, allowing separate units to maintain independence while staying interdependent.

4. Society (central orchestrator): A central orchestrator ensures that all units function in harmony, iterating over time to adapt and refine the system. This is the core of societal evolution, where interactions between units are monitored and dynamically adjusted.

Applications

Using these four rules, Optimus successfully models a range of institutional structures, such as:

- The French Fifth Republic: Simulating the interaction of political systems and governance structures.
- Franprix: A model of a grocery store’s operational cycles, including sales and restocking.
- A Bakery: Representing economic processes on a micro level.
- Plain Autopoietic Systems: Complex, theoretical social systems modeled to test self-referential and adaptive behaviors.

This institutional logic allows Optimus to expand and adapt across various systems, illustrating how a consistent framework can be applied to both societal and economic structures.
